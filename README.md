# Fraud-prevention-and-Employment-Integrity-Analyst-using-Machine-Learning
The rise of digital job boards and online recruitment platforms has introduced convenience but also increased the risk of encountering fraudulent job postings. Fake job listings often aim to scam individuals by collecting sensitive information or exploiting users in various ways. Detecting such fake job postings is a critical challenge to ensure user safety and trust in online platforms.

This project focuses on predicting whether a job posting is genuine or fake using various machine learning algorithms and ensemble techniques. By analyzing the text and metadata of job descriptions, the model aims to classify job postings as either legitimate or fraudulent.

Key Objectives:
Data Analysis: Analyze the structure and content of job postings, including job titles, company names, descriptions, and requirements.
Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features such as word frequency, grammatical patterns, sentiment, and metadata like location and company reputation.
Algorithm Implementation: Utilize multiple machine learning algorithms, including:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): For classifying jobs based on similarity to known examples.
Naive Bayes: To evaluate probabilities based on the text data and prior probabilities.
Random Forest: To provide robust predictions through multiple decision trees.
Logistic Regression: For understanding the linear relationship between features and outcomes.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): For finding optimal hyperplanes that separate fake and real job posts.

Ensemble Learning: Combine the strengths of individual models using ensemble methods like voting or stacking to improve overall predictive accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion
This project effectively applies ensemble learning algorithms to classify job postings as either genuine or fake. By analyzing the textual and metadata features of job descriptions, the model ensures accurate predictions, helping job seekers identify fraudulent postings. This not only saves their time and money but also protects them from the loss of sensitive personal information, contributing to a safer and more trustworthy online recruitment environment.
